       "u\"Of all the deprivations of being homeless, the worst was believing I had nothing to give.\\\\n\\\\nA few years ago I found myself homeless. There was no good excuse for it. I had an excellent upbringing, I have a college degree, I had had a career in public relations, but then several things happened at once - I quit working, my mother died, I let my clinical depression go unchecked and untreated and simply lost all my savings, then my home, then my belongings. The only thing I had left was my pride, which isolated me from my friends and family and prevented me from getting the help I needed.\\\\n\\\\nOddly enough, it wasn't the possessions or the stability I missed most - it was the fact that I didn't feel like I was contributing. I wasn't using my talents, and I wasn't donating to things which had always been important to me. I wasn't even volunteering.\\\\n\\\\nI finally got help, entered a shelter run by Inter-Faith Ministries, started taking an anti-depressant, reached out to people and began the long journey back to a productive, happy life. \\\\n\\\\nThe staff at Inter-Faith Ministries might have saved my life. They provided support and friendship when I was still unwilling to involve my friends and family in my 'shame.' They then gave me a job - I started working in one of the homeless shelters as a house manager, something I still do one day a week in spite of the fact that I now work full time as Marketing Coordinator for the organization. While the marketing gig is exciting and certainly in line with my talents and education, I enjoy working with the residents in the shelter too much to stop. I also like to think that my story can help some of them get over the despair and shame of homelessness and regain their lives.\\\\n\\\\nOne of my proudest moments was when I was financially able to begin contributing financially again. My first step was to reinstate my monthly pledge with the local public radio station. That came before I even bought a bed because giving to and supporting others was more important to me in my road back to a 'normal' life than getting my mattress off the floor!\\\\n\\\\nI still don't advertise the fact that I have been homeless. I recently gave a talk to a group that included a couple people who had known me 25 years ago when I worked at the symphony. While it was great to catch up with them - and while it was great to hear them both say they really missed me and were so glad to know I was working with Inter-Faith - I didn't announce that it was because they had housed me for a year while I become whole again. There will always be some shame that I allowed this to happen to myself.\\\\n\\\\nInter-Faith Ministries, while it focuses on services for homeless and low-income people (three shelters, 104 low-income apartments, lunch program, holiday food/coat/toy distribution) also, as its name implies, brings together different faith groups. The organization has been around for 130 years and has always strived to celebrate both the diversity and the similarities of various religions. I like that in one day I can work and talk with Catholics, Hindus, evangelical Christians, Muslims and agnostics. \\\\n\\\\nWe do it on a shoestring budget. We have a wish list a mile long - improvements to our shelters, which all suffer from inadequate kitchens, plumbing and broken beds. We want to start a produce garden to use for meal preparation and to give our residents the opportunity to help and perhaps learn a marketable skill. We want to reinstate an inter-religious study series. \\\\n\\\\nThe main thing, however, is we want...need... to continue to shelter those most in need and save lives. Just like IFM saved mine.\""

But a little over 2 years ago my 2 year old was officially diagnosed autistic. And honestly I'd barely heard of it. I cried for days, I sank into a pitty of tears and why me, why my daughter. I felt scared as if I had failed her. Then I googled, I searched, I looked high and low. I found many sites the first one not so helpful, I won't name any names but I'll say they offered me a packet to do a fundraiser and walk for them. However they were unable to help me with any other help as my daughter wasn't in their criteria as considered she was a girl and not a boy and I guess they is more of a boy issue ( funny I've got three girls on various end of the spectrum and not a boy one ) . Then I found Kulturecity and was instantly welcomed, I got various opinions from their 'groupies' on their page . My girls were sent a toy and man the smile on their face that someone they've never met cared enough to send them a gift in the mail was more than enough to warm my heart. I've donated and helped out as much as possible because everything they have it paid forward. However my most memorable donation was a couple of gifts I sent to Santa for autism Christmas. I bet you didn't know we have a special Christmas for our special kids. Many of us received mail to be opened on April ( autism awareness month ) 25th . And many of us cooked and celebrate ( toned down a bit ) same as we do for December 25th. I now try to set aside a little a paycheck for when special events or fundraiser are being done. Because I can not think of a better way to pay it forward. They are the all about the smiles of our kids, my kids, your kids.\n",
